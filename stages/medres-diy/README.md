INTERNAL NOTES

NOTE: We **DO NOT SUPPORT** these build instructions. They are left as a community resource, but it in fact may discourage customers from purchasing our solution (if we had any business sense we wouldn't post them in our github). Check carefully for assembly details, as vendor parts may change which stops this solution from working. If you proceed with the self-build solution you are on your own!

Be aware that we've put effort into compiling this list for our own R&D -
